-- Settlement / revenue-recognition money correctness fixes
--
-- Fixes four confirmed money bugs in recognize_project_revenue /
-- settle_project_month (all found in an audit):
--
--  #1 Stale revenue: recognition never retired a revenue_entries row whose
--     source was later deactivated / soft-deleted / re-dated out of the month,
--     so the funding pool kept counting revenue that no longer exists
--     (over-paying freelancers & inflating referrals). Now recognition retires
--     auto-generated entries for the month whose source is no longer
--     active/in-window, and its upsert un-deletes a revived entry (#8).
--
--  #2 Stale referrals: symmetric — a referral_earnings row for a since-removed
--     or re-dated referral kept being subtracted from the pool, under-funding
--     freelancer invoices. Settlement now retires earnings whose referral is no
--     longer active/in-window, and its upsert un-deletes revived earnings.
--
--  #3 Retainer months: settlement only recognized months drawn from time
--     entries / existing revenue rows / invoices, so a recurring source's months
--     with no other activity were never recognized and their revenue never
--     entered the pool. The month set now also enumerates every month in each
--     active recurring source's window (up to the settled period).
--
--  #4 Late-approval underpay: settlement tagged EVERY approved-billable-untagged
--     entry in the month to the invoice but paid the `earned_cents` frozen at
--     submit time, so time approved after submission was tagged (frozen) yet
--     never paid. Settlement now recomputes earned_cents/worked_minutes from the
--     entries it actually tags (using the invoice's snapshot rate) before
--     allocating, so the freelancer is paid for all approved work in the month.
